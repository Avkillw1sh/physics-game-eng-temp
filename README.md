# physics-game-eng-temp
--program in C++ to simulate a physics engine for a video game--

Steps to follow:
1. Define the objects in the game that require physics simulation.
2. Create a data structure to store the properties of these objects, such as position, velocity, mass, and acceleration.
3. Implement the equations of motion for these objects, such as Newton's laws of motion.
4. Use a time step to update the positions and velocities of the objects in each frame of the game.
5. Handle collisions between objects using collision detection algorithms, and apply appropriate forces to simulate the physics of the collision.

The C++ code is a basic template code to get you started with.
